# r200

Object track/detection with camera R200 and library realsense

This project is meant to provide some extra information about player behavior in a RoboGame for the PhD project at Politecnico di Milano,  Italy. Contact: github.com/ewerlopes/phd_robogame

Based in OpenCV, C++ and lib realsense(INTEL) it is adapted to work similarly to kinect camera (but stationary) in recording the game and extracting interesting movement features from the player.

Dependecies
It uses extra libraries:
librealsense: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense
gnuplot: external script for visualization plots
