This project is meant to provide some extra information about player behavior in a RoboGame for the PhD project at Politecnico di Milano,  Italy. Contact: <<ewerlopes/phd_robogame>>

Based in OpenCV, C++ and lib realsense(INTEL) it is adapted to work similarly to kinect camera (but stationary) in recording the game and extracting interesting movement features from the player.
